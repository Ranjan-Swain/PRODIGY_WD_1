<h1>PRODIGY_WD_1</h1>
<P>This is task 1 of my Web Development internship at Prodigy InfoTech. In this task I have to develop a navigation menu. The navigation menu should have responsiveness and a fixed position. For task 1 I developed a landing page for a manga reading website and named the webpage as <b>Otaku</b>. The landing page of <b>Otaku</b> contains a navigation menu,poster, and 2 buttons for logging-in or signing-up. In the navigation menu I added some hovering effects on the menu items and also included a sidebar menu, which will only be visible when the hamburger menu icon is clicked. </P>
